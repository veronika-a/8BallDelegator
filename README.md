## Magic eight ball

### Conventions
- All images should be stored inside `Assets` in appropriate subfolder (note: when creating a new folder in assets you must check "Provide namespace" in order to make it appear correctly in swiftgen's generated class)
- All colors should be stored inside `Colors` (note: colors naming obtained with Sip color picker tool; in order to prevent colors duplications it should be used by all teammates)
- All strings must be localized
- The files structure on the disk should correspond to the file structure in Xcode (do not forget to order your files alphabetically once created) - You should use `Autolayout` dsl in order to define layout for your view
- You should use either MVVM architecture for your flows (both file templates avaiable)
- You shouldn't use NavigationNode's flow for any events not related to the navigation
- You shouldn't expose Rx or UIKit into the Core framework
